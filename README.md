Cardstock is a lightweight Lua-based OS for the M5Stack Cardputer.

The project currently builds a Lua VM and loads a lua entrypoint (which will eventually be a launcher)

I am currently writing Lua bindings for all the M5Cardputer libraries, starting with the GFX library right now.

DISCLAIMER: A decent portion of the C++ is written by AI right now. The plan is to go back and check over/rewrite this later as I add more complex functionality to the "bootloader".
